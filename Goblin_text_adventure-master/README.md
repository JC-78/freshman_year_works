# Goblin_text_adventure
Text adventure game made with Python. You wake up in a dark chamber and find yourself behind the bars. You find a corpse next to you, and there’s a message written in blood.  “If you are reading this message, it probably means I’m already dead and a goblin is planning to have you as his next meal. Before you get eaten, break the lock and get out. I was able to wear it down enough over days with a sharp stone I found, but I no longer have enough energy left to escape this place. Get out and take any of the weapons in that creature’s torture chamber. You should be able to find the key to its room in the storage; that goblin always leave it there. Kill it and you will be able to leave this place. That thing is always carrying the key to the exit with it 24/7…best of luck.”
